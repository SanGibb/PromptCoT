A 360&deg; panorama of the OzSky Star Safari 2014, at the Warrumbungles Mountain Motel near Coonabarabran, NSW, Australia, taken April 1 2014. The centre of the Galaxy area in Scorpius and Sagittarius is rising just left of centre (east); the Southern Cross and Carina Nebula area is at the peak of the arch of the Milky Way, at their highest for the night (south); Canis Major is setting at right (west). The Magellanic Clouds are above the trees at centre. At upper left is Mars, a week away from opposition. The Gegenschein is visible as a diffuse glow just left of Mars, the brightest part of the Zodiacal Band which runs from the Milky Way and Antares up tp Mars then off the frame at upper left. The Dark Emu figure made of dark clouds in the Milky Way is almost all above the horizon with his head in the Coal Sack at top centre, and his neck and bodt running down the Milky Way to the left toward the horizon. <br /> <br /> This is a 6-section panorama with the Canon 60Da at ISO 3200 and 60 second exposures, untracked, with the 8mm fish-eye lens at f/3.5. Lighting and movement between segments produces some blending issues. But PTGui spliced the frames together very well and effortlessly.<br /> <br /> Taken after it had clouded over for a time then cleared, so some scopes had been covered up.

Definitely, Instagram, and Tumblr: bellabucchiotti: My Trip to Northern Norway I went on a trip to northern Norway for 10 days. It was an amazing trip and I will never forget it. Definitely a trip of a lifetime. We were there in early September and we got to experience great weather most days…although it was chilly and best of all we got to see the aurora most nights. READ MORE HERE about my trip to Norway and my Northern Norway travel guide.  You can also follow Bella Bucchiotti on Instagram and YouTube!!   Thanks to Joel Schat for the video.

The Tree of Life by artist Laura Zollar... I just love the colors ...
"""A customer feel in love with one of my mermaid paintings but felt that she could not afford the large original plus the original was too large for the space she intended. SO I am making a canvas giclee smaller 12x36"""". The original is 20x60"""". I use only top fine art printers and give them the original to match as reference. Photographing your art properly is very important in this process. Making sure the  proportions are spot on and that all of the edge beyond the edge of the canvas is removed. As a professional photographer, I own some very good cameras so am able to get a very high resolution image file that is close to 100 MB."""

"I really enjoyed working on this painting which I started after I completed the commission for Vicki of an abstract waterfall. I was inspired to explore more possibilities. This is 20x60"" with lots of texture. I started with a quality gallery wrap canvas and sketched the basic nature scene with a waterfall as central element. Then I put flexible modeling paste with various knives. I kept with the drawing so the details became sculptural. Then I added orange paint to white gesso and coated the plaster and canvas so I had a totally orange surface. After couple more days of drying, I was able to start painting with huge brushes and knives. It evolved daily for another week. I am just about to put the final varnish on it."

A 360° night panorama, lit by moonlight, taken from the boardwalk out to Pryamid Island on Pyramid Lake in Jasper National Park. Contructed in the 1930s, the Boardwalk takes you to a popular picnic spot, Pyramid Island at the north end of Pyramid Lake. The view across the water to the surrounding mountains is wonderful by day and by night. By night, this is a fabulous place for stargazing in this Dark Sky Preserve. <br /> <br /> Here, south is at left, toward Mt. Edith Cavell. To the southwest, the waxing gibbous Moon is setting. At right of centre, the Boardwalk leads to Pyramid Island itself, with Pyramid Mountain behind it. Right of the island is the Big Dipper. To the right of the image, to the northeast, there's a weak aurora display. The Milky Way is faintly visible in the moonlit sky overhead. <br /> <br /> This an 8-segement panorama, taken with the 15mm full-frame fisheye lens and Canon 6D. Each segment was a 32-second exposure at f/2.8 and ISO 1250, stitched with PTGui.

The Milky Way arches across this 360-degree panorama of the night sky above the Paranal Observatory, home of ESO's Very Large Telescope. The Moon is just rising and the zodiacal light shines above it, while the Milky Way stretches across the sky opposite the observatory. To the right in the image and below the arc of the Milky Way, two of our galactic neighbours, the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, can be seen. The open telescope domes of the world's most advanced ground-based astronomical observatory are all visible in the image: the four smaller 1.8-metre Auxiliary Telescopes that can be used together in the interferometric mode, and the four giant 8.2-metre Unit Telescopes. The image was made from 37 individual frames with a total exposure time of about 30 minutes, taken in the early morning hours.

Contructed in the 1930s, the Boardwalk takes you to a popular picnic spot, Pyramid Island at the north end of Pyramid Lake. The view across the water to the surrounding mountains is wonderful by day and by night. By night, this is a fabulous place for stargazing in this Dark Sky Preserve. <br /> <br /> Here, south is at left, toward Mt. Edith Cavell. To the southwest, the waxing gibbous Moon is setting. At right of centre, the Boardwalk leads to Pyramid Island itself, with Pyramid Mountain behind it. Right of the island is the Big Dipper. To the right of the image, to the northeast, there&rsquo;s a weak aurora display. The Milky Way is faintly visible in the moonlit sky overhead. <br /> <br /> This an 8-segement panorama, taken with the 15mm full-frame fisheye lens and Canon 6D. Each segment was a 32-second exposure at f/2.8 and ISO 1250, stitched with PTGui.
Jordan Pond in Acadia National Park takes on a quiet serenity when shrouded in fog. The air feels muffled and the normal sounds one expects from nature dissapate into the atmosphere. Pause and reflect.

A 360&deg; panorama of the entire sky over the historic and pioneer Larson Ranch site in the Frenchman River Valley in Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada. Grasslands in a Dark Sky Preserve and from most of the Park no lights at all can be seen and none light the sky. This is the natural sky, complete with colourful sky glows. <br /> <br /> The clouds here look dark, silhouettted against at sky lit only by natural sources: the stars, the Milky Way, the aurora at right, and a general airglow tinting the sky green to the north at right, with some red bands of airglow at left to the south. All ground illumination here is from these natural night light sources.<br /> <br /> The Milky Way was arching overhead when I shot this, so in this &ldquo;equirectangular&rdquo; projection it stretches up from the south at left of centre and spreads out across the top of the frame then descends to the northeast at right. The Pleiades is rising at lower right and at upper right is the Andromeda Galaxy. The Big Dipper is just right of centre low on the northern horizon. From this latitude of 49&deg; N the Big Dipper is circumpolar. <br /> <br /> This is a stitch of 32 panels, shot with the iOptron iPano motorized panning mount, each panel being 40 seconds at f/2.8 with the Sigma 24mm lens and Nikon D750 at ISO 6400. Overlap was 35%. Stitched with PTGui.

A 360&deg; panorama of the winter sky over Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, on February 28, 2017. The Milky Way arches across the sky from south (left) to northeast (right). The Zodiacal Light stretches up from the western horizon at centre. The Gegenschein is faintly visible above the horizon at far left in Leo. <br /> <br /> Orion is left of centre; the Pleiades sit at the tip of the Zodiacal Light pyramid of light. <br /> <br /> The ground is lit only by starlight. No artificial illumination or light painting applied. <br /> <br /> This is a stitch of 6 segments taken with the 12mm full-fame fish-eye Rokinon lens at f/2.8, all 30-second exposures with the Nikon D750 at ISO 6400. The camera was aimed portrait with the segments at 60&deg; spacings. Stitched with PTGui using equirectangular projection with the zeith pulled down slightly.

These are saga map illustrations done for the mobile game Kitchen Scramble.  Each land had its own theme bassed on an existing place or event.  There also had to be a huge presence of food structures or landmarks on them. These maps shared pretty much the same loose 2-point perspective and had to flow as seamlessly as possible into each other.  The roads later contained level dots and some UI elements went over the upper and lower parts of the screen.  This is where the player selects whichever level they wanna play or replay during the course of the game.  Ambient map animations (not shown) were added by Benjamin Paras. Art Directors :  Charles Suwannaporn  Art Lead:  U-bin Li

London from Southwark. Oil on wood. This is a view of London taken from Southwark in the mid-1600s before the Great Fire. It shows Southwark in the foreground, with the playhouses on the left-hand side and the cathedral in the centre. London Bridge spans the river and then the City of London itself is on the north bank of the Thames, shown as a huddle of crowded, narrow houses and church spires. The writer John Evelyn described London as 'this Glorious and Antient City…so full of Stink and Darknesse' in his Fumifugium of 1661. He went on to call the buildings 'such a Congestion of mishapen and extravagant Houses'. This 'congestion' of houses and industries belched out huge amounts of smoke into the atmosphere and created a massive fire risk. The Great Fire of London was an accident waiting to happen.

View of neolthic Castlerigg Stone Circle monaliths and the Lake District, England,  built circa 2500 BC.<br /> <br /> Castlerigg Stone Circle was built around 4500 years ago by prehistoric farming communities who settles in the fertile valleys of the Lake District.  Current thinking has linked Castlerigg with the Neolithic Langdale axe industry in the nearby Langdale fells: the circle may have been a meeting place where these axes were traded or exchanged. Ritually deposited stone axes have been found all over Britain, suggesting that their uses went far beyond their practical capabilities. Exchange or trading of stone axes may not have been possible without first taking part in a ritual or ceremony.

A wonderful pano over Boom Lake includes from L to R, Bident, Bell, Castle, Boom, Storm and Whymper.
A 360&deg; panorama of the southern hemisphere autumn sky over the observing field at the 2017 OzSky Star Party, at the Warrumbungles Mountain Motel, near Coonabarabran, NSW, Australia. The entire southern Milky Way arches overhead, from Scorpius and Sagittarius rising at left, to Carina and Crux high in the south at centre, to Canis Major and Puppis setting at right. <br /> <br /> The Large Magellanic Cloud is at right of centre. The formation of the Dark Emu in dark dust lanes in the Milky Way is at centre, rising. Some red bands of airglow discolour the sky. <br /> <br /> Jupiter is the bright object at left, with the Gegenschein glow at the anti-solar point between Jupiter and the Milky Way. The faint Zodiacal Band can be seen arching across the sky at left, in the northern sky. The Milky Way dominates the southern sky. The South Celestial Pole is above the tree at right of centre. <br /> <br /> The telescopes on the field are mostly large Dobsonian reflectors in the 18- to 30-inch class, for use of the star party participants. <br /> <br /> This is a stitch of 8 segments, each 30 seconds at f/2.5 with the Rokinon 14mm lens, in portrait orientation, and with the Canon 6D at ISO 6400. Stitched with PTGui in equirectangular projection.

Besseggen is one of the most popular hikes in Norway. The mountain ridge of Besseggen (or Besseggi) rises between green Lake Gjende and blue lake Bessvatnet in Oppland county, in Jotunheimen (the Home of the Giants, the highest section of the Scandinavian Mountains), Norway. Ride a boat from Gjendesheim to Memurubu, then hike along the trail to narrow Besseggen at the halfway point. Then ascend to the trail's highest point, Veslfjellet (1743 meters), and walk steeply down to Gjendesheim, in about 8 to 10 hours total. Pretty Lake Gjende is colored green from glacier runoff containing clay (rock flour). Panorama stitched from 6 overlapping photos.

LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII by AlexandreMorsilla
sea quilts - Google Search
The &ldquo;river of stars&rdquo; &ndash; the Milky Way &ndash;&nbsp;arching over the scenic bend of the Red Deer River, Alberta, from the Orkney Viewpoint overlooking the Badlands and river valley, in a 270&deg; panorama. To the north at left, a weak aurora shines along the horizon. Bands of airglow also colour the sky to the east at centre, and perpetual twilight lights the sky at far left. <br /> <br /> To the south at right, the Milky Way becomes lost amid the light pollution from Drumheller, Alberta, made more obvious by some clouds drifting through. <br /> <br /> So this is a study in skyglows: aurora, twilight, airglow, Milky Way and urban skyglow, and of the contrast between the natural sky and light polluted sky. <br /> <br /> And of course, I like the way the curve of the Milky Way is mirrored in the curve of the river, which is why I picked this spot and this night in spring, when the Milky Way is still arching across the east and not overhead as it is later in summer. <br /> <br /> The most prominent stars reflected in the still waters of the rive are the stars of Delphinus the Dolphin, but there are no dolphins in this river! Only ones made of stars. <br /> <br /> This is a stitch of 8 segments with the Sigma 20mm Art lens, in portrait mode, and Nikon D750. Each 30 seconds at f/2 and ISO 3200. Stitched with Adobe Camera Raw. Taken on a mild and moonless night, May 20, 2017.

Definitely, Instagram, and Tumblr: bellabucchiotti: My Trip to Northern Norway I went on a trip to northern Norway for 10 days. It was an amazing trip and I will never forget it. Definitely a trip of a lifetime. We were there in early September and we got to experience great weather most days…although it was chilly and best of all we got to see the aurora most nights. READ MORE HERE about my trip to Norway and my Northern Norway travel guide.  You can also follow Bella Bucchiotti on Instagram and YouTube!!   Thanks to Joel Schat for the video.

A 360&deg; panorama of the OzSky Star Safari 2014, at the Warrumbungles Mountain Motel near Coonabarabran, NSW, Australia, taken April 1 2014. The centre of the Galaxy area in Scorpius and Sagittarius is rising just left of centre (east); the Southern Cross and Carina Nebula area is at the peak of the arch of the Milky Way, at their highest for the night (south); Canis Major is setting at right (west). The Magellanic Clouds are above the trees at centre. At upper left is Mars, a week away from opposition. The Gegenschein is visible as a diffuse glow just left of Mars, the brightest part of the Zodiacal Band which runs from the Milky Way and Antares up tp Mars then off the frame at upper left. The Dark Emu figure made of dark clouds in the Milky Way is almost all above the horizon with his head in the Coal Sack at top centre, and his neck and bodt running down the Milky Way to the left toward the horizon. <br /> <br /> This is a 6-section panorama with the Canon 60Da at ISO 3200 and 60 second exposures, untracked, with the 8mm fish-eye lens at f/3.5. Lighting and movement between segments produces some blending issues. But PTGui spliced the frames together very well and effortlessly.<br /> <br /> Taken after it had clouded over for a time then cleared, so some scopes had been covered up.

A 360&deg; panorama of the night sky and prairie landscape from the Visitor Centre and farmyard at the Old Man on His Back Prairie &amp; Heritage Conservation Area in southwest Saskatchewan. The Milky Way arches across the eastern sky from north to south, while an aurora display (faint to the naked eye) glows in an arch of green and magenta across the northern horizon. The pioneer house was built in the 1920s and this was a working ranch until the 1990s when the land was turned over to the Nature Conservancy of Canada to turn into a natural area to preserve the short grass prairie habitat. <br /> <br /> This a stitch of 8 segments, each a 1 minute untracked exposure at f/3.5 with the 15mm lens and ISO 4000 with the Canon 6D. Stitched with PTGui software. I shot these May 18, 2015.

Definitely, Instagram, and Tumblr: bellabucchiotti: My Trip to Northern Norway I went on a trip to northern Norway for 10 days. It was an amazing trip and I will never forget it. Definitely a trip of a lifetime. We were there in early September and we got to experience great weather most days…although it was chilly and best of all we got to see the aurora most nights. READ MORE HERE about my trip to Norway and my Northern Norway travel guide.  You can also follow Bella Bucchiotti on Instagram and YouTube!!   Thanks to Joel Schat for the video.

Although the insane color of the lake might make you think otherwise, the lake really is this blue - in fact in my search of pictures of Moraine Lake on the web, I have not been able to find an image that captures the scale, color, and beauty of this amazing place better than this image.<br /> <br /> I have this image available for purchase printed on a stunning 55x17"" fine art gallery wrapped canvas (other sizes available but due to the incredible resolution of 30 combined images, it is best viewed BIG!)

A 360&deg; panorama of the entire sky over the historic and pioneer Larson Ranch site in the Frenchman River Valley in Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada. Grasslands in a Dark Sky Preserve and from most of the Park no lights at all can be seen and none light the sky. This is the natural sky, complete with colourful sky glows. <br /> <br /> The clouds here look dark, silhouettted against at sky lit only by natural sources: the stars, the Milky Way, the aurora at right, and a general airglow tinting the sky green to the north at right, with some red bands of airglow at left to the south. All ground illumination here is from these natural night light sources.<br /> <br /> The Milky Way was arching overhead when I shot this, so in this &ldquo;equirectangular&rdquo; projection it stretches up from the south at left of centre and spreads out across the top of the frame then descends to the northeast at right. The Pleiades is rising at lower right and at upper right is the Andromeda Galaxy. The Big Dipper is just right of centre low on the northern horizon. From this latitude of 49&deg; N the Big Dipper is circumpolar. <br /> <br /> This is a stitch of 32 panels, shot with the iOptron iPano motorized panning mount, each panel being 40 seconds at f/2.8 with the Sigma 24mm lens and Nikon D750 at ISO 6400. Overlap was 35%. Stitched with PTGui.

A 360&deg; panorama of the Milky Way and night sky taken at Cameron Lake in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada. I shot this Sept 21, 2014 on a very clear night with no noticeable aurora and very little airglow. The ground is lit solely by starlight. The lake was very calm and reflects the southern Milky Way.<br /> <br /> This is a stitch of 8 segments, each shot with the 15mm full-frame fisheye lens, for 1 minute at f/2.8 and with the Canon 6D at ISO 4000. I used PTGui to stitch the segments, with this version being an equirectangular projection.

These are saga map illustrations done for the mobile game Kitchen Scramble.  Each land had its own theme bassed on an existing place or event.  There also had to be a huge presence of food structures or landmarks on them.  These maps shared pretty much the same loose 2-point perspective and had to flow as seamlessly as possible into each other.  The roads later contained level dots and some UI elements went over the upper and lower parts of the screen.  This is where the player selects whichever level they wanna play or replay during the course of the game.   Ambient map animations (not shown) were added by  Benjamin Paras .  Art Directors :   Charles Suwannaporn    Art Lead:   U-bin Li

"""I really enjoyed working on this painting which I started after I completed the commission for Vicki of an abstract waterfall. I was inspired to explore more possibilities. This is 20x60"""" with lots of texture. I started with a quality gallery wrap canvas and sketched the basic nature scene with a waterfall as central element. Then I put flexible modeling paste with various knives. I kept with the drawing so the details became sculptural. Then I added orange paint to white gesso and coated the plaster and canvas so I had a totally orange surface. After couple more days of drying, I was able to start painting with huge brushes and knives. It evolved daily for another week. I am just about to put the final varnish on it."""

The entry way on the right opens into the First Hypostyle Hall, which was built by Seti's son Ramses II after his father's death. The lighted room on the far left is the Sanctuary of Seti I. It is one of the seven separate chapels/sanctuaries that line the entire length of the left wall. Each sanctuary is dedicated to one of the following dieties: Horus, Isis, Osiris, Amun-Re, Re-Harakhiti, Ptah, and Seti I.<br /> <br /> Looking at this picture always immediately put me back inside the temple itself.

"""Panoramic view of the Moorish Islmaic Alhambra Palace comples and fortifications. Granada, Andalusia, Spain. . The Alhambra is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in 889 CE on the remains of ancient Roman fortifications. The Alhambra was renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Arab Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current Alhambra palace and walls. The Alhambra was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. The decoration of The Alhambra consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions—mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace—that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (""""Ataurique""""). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (""""alicatado"""") of The Alhambra, with complicated mathematical patterns (""""tracería"""", most precisely """"lacería""""), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. .<br /> <br /> Visit our SPAIN HISTORIC PLACXES PHOTO COLLECTIONS for more photos to download or buy as wall art prints https://funkystock.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/Pictures-Images-of-Spain-Spanish-Historical-Archaeology-Sites-Museum-Antiquities/C0000EUVhLC3Nbgw <br /> .<br /> Visit our ISLAMIC HISTORICAL PLACES PHOTO COLLECTIONS for more photos to download or buy as wall art prints https://funkystock.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/Islam-Islamic-Historic-Places-Architecture-Pictures-Images-of/C0000n7SGOHt9XWI"""

A 360&deg; panorama of the night sky and prairie landscape from the Visitor Centre and farmyard at the Old Man on His Back Prairie &amp; Heritage Conservation Area in southwest Saskatchewan. The Milky Way arches across the eastern sky from north to south, while an aurora display (faint to the naked eye) glows in an arch of green and magenta across the northern horizon. The pioneer house was built in the 1920s and this was a working ranch until the 1990s when the land was turned over to the Nature Conservancy of Canada to turn into a natural area to preserve the short grass prairie habitat. <br /> <br /> This a stitch of 8 segments, each a 1 minute untracked exposure at f/3.5 with the 15mm lens and ISO 4000 with the Canon 6D. Stitched with PTGui software. I shot these May 18, 2015.

A 360&deg; panorama of the southern hemisphere autumn sky over the observing field at the 2017 OzSky Star Party, at the Warrumbungles Mountain Motel, near Coonabarabran, NSW, Australia. The entire southern Milky Way arches overhead, from Scorpius and Sagittarius rising at left, to Carina and Crux high in the south at centre, to Canis Major and Puppis setting at right. <br /> <br /> The Large Magellanic Cloud is at right of centre. The formation of the Dark Emu in dark dust lanes in the Milky Way is at centre, rising. Some red bands of airglow discolour the sky. <br /> <br /> Jupiter is the bright object at left, with the Gegenschein glow at the anti-solar point between Jupiter and the Milky Way. The faint Zodiacal Band can be seen arching across the sky at left, in the northern sky. The Milky Way dominates the southern sky. The South Celestial Pole is above the tree at right of centre. <br /> <br /> The telescopes on the field are mostly large Dobsonian reflectors in the 18- to 30-inch class, for use of the star party participants. <br /> <br /> This is a stitch of 8 segments, each 30 seconds at f/2.5 with the Rokinon 14mm lens, in portrait orientation, and with the Canon 6D at ISO 6400. Stitched with PTGui in equirectangular projection.

View of neolthic Castlerigg Stone Circle monaliths and the Lake District, England,  built circa 2500 BC.<br /> <br /> Castlerigg Stone Circle was built around 4500 years ago by prehistoric farming communities who settles in the fertile valleys of the Lake District.  Current thinking has linked Castlerigg with the Neolithic Langdale axe industry in the nearby Langdale fells: the circle may have been a meeting place where these axes were traded or exchanged. Ritually deposited stone axes have been found all over Britain, suggesting that their uses went far beyond their practical capabilities. Exchange or trading of stone axes may not have been possible without first taking part in a ritual or ceremony.

"A customer feel in love with one of my mermaid paintings but felt that she could not afford the large original plus the original was too large for the space she intended. SO I am making a canvas giclee smaller 12x36"". The original is 20x60"". I use only top fine art printers and give them the original to match as reference. Photographing your art properly is very important in this process. Making sure the  proportions are spot on and that all of the edge beyond the edge of the canvas is removed. As a professional photographer, I own some very good cameras so am able to get a very high resolution image file that is close to 100 MB."

Castildeterra rock formation in the Bardena Blanca area of the Bardenas Riales Natural Park, Navarre, Spain . The Bardenas Reales (sometimes referred as Bárdenas Reales) is a semi-desert natural region, or badlands, of some 42,000 hectares (420 km2; 104,000 acres) in southeast Navarre (Spain). The soils are made up of clay, chalk and sandstone and have been eroded by water and wind creating surprising shapes, canyons, plateaus, tabular structures and isolated hills, called cabezos. Bardenas Reales lacks urban areas, vegetation is scarce and the many streams that cross the territory have a markedly seasonal flow, staying dry most of the year.<br /> <br /> Visit our SPAIN HISTORIC PLACES PHOTO COLLECTIONS for more photos to download or buy as wall art prints https://funkystock.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/Pictures-Images-of-Spain-Spanish-Historical-Archaeology-Sites-Museum-Antiquities/C0000EUVhLC3Nbgw

These are saga map illustrations done for the mobile game Kitchen Scramble.  Each land had its own theme bassed on an existing place or event.  There also had to be a huge presence of food structures or landmarks on them.  These maps shared pretty much the same loose 2-point perspective and had to flow as seamlessly as possible into each other.  The roads later contained level dots and some UI elements went over the upper and lower parts of the screen.  This is where the player selects whichever level they wanna play or replay during the course of the game.   Ambient map animations (not shown) were added by  Benjamin Paras .  Art Directors :   Charles Suwannaporn    Art Lead:   U-bin Li

A 180° panorama of a modest aurora display behind grain bins on an Alberta country road. The aurora adds more color to a sky also filled with green airglow, while at the ends of the roads are yellow glows of light pollution, from Strathmore and Calgary at left, and Bassano at right. For a few minutes there was also the sharp edge at left to the aurora rays, present in 3 frames of the panorama, so it is not an artifact of the stitching. The Big Dipper is left of centre, low in the north.

"MONSTER MOON RISE - 14 August 2014<br /> <br /> Moon Rise Between the Mittens - Monument Valley Tribal Park<br /> <br /> Link to full sized image:  <a href=""http://www.tom-hill.biz/Galleries/Scenics/Arizona/i-4tc83SX/A"">http://www.tom-hill.biz/Galleries/Scenics/Arizona/i-4tc83SX/A</a><br /> __________<br /> <br /> There has been a lot of hyperbole used when describing the recent full moons--Giant, Super, Monster.  Really, it's the same moon as it has been for billions of years.  It just happens to be at perigee in its orbit around the earth when its full.  The moon is on an elliptical orbit meaning in its travels there are times when it's closer than other times.  Perigee is when the moon is at its closest point in its orbit.  This is simple orbital mechanics.  It happens.  It's like predictable and you've probably seen it before and thought ""wow, the moon looks so obvious.""  And, yo probably didn't use super in your description.<br /> <br /> Words making it sound like it's the regular moon except on steroids don't have to be used to adequately describe whats going on (no drugs were involved in the size of the moon unless you happen to use them yourself).  I believe words such as ""super"" that emphasize the dramatic should be reserved for those times when it is special.  After all, what word do you use when there's truly something amazing going on, like a once in a lifetime event?  Do you use ""super awesome"" as a way to taking it to ""11""--if you've seen the movie, ""This is Spinal Tap,"" you'll understand what taking it to ""11"" means.<br /> <br /> I made my way to Monument Valley this past weekend to shoot the full moon.  It was a great night with clouds, color, and wonderful scenery.  Not everything came together just as I hoped.  The moon was too low in an obscuring haze when the last red light of the setting sun disappeared from the Mittens.  Still, it was a wonderful sight to behold.<br /> <br /> Cheers<br /> <br /> Tom"

A stargazing session under the autumn Milky Way, at the City of Rocks State Park, New Mexico, at the Park Observatory in the Orion Group Camping Area, Nov 22, 2014. The Milky Way arches from horizon to horizon in this 360&deg; panorama, from Sagittarius setting at left to Taurus rising at right. At left to the west is the last glow of twilight plus the Zodiacal Light climbing up to the left in the southwest. To the east at centre and to the south at right are some bands of green airglow. At far right is the horizon glow from the lights of Deming, NM. <br /><br />This is a panorama of 8 segments, at 45&deg; spacings, shot with the 15mm full-frame fish-eye lens in portrait orientation, with each segment a 1-minute exposure at f/2.8 and ISO 3200 with the Canon 6D. Noise reduction turned on. The segments were stitched with PTGui.

"""MONSTER MOON RISE - 14 August 2014<br /> <br /> Moon Rise Between the Mittens - Monument Valley Tribal Park<br /> <br /> Link to full sized image:  <a href=""""http://www.tom-hill.biz/Galleries/Scenics/Arizona/i-4tc83SX/A"""">http://www.tom-hill.biz/Galleries/Scenics/Arizona/i-4tc83SX/A</a><br /> __________<br /> <br /> There has been a lot of hyperbole used when describing the recent full moons--Giant, Super, Monster.  Really, it's the same moon as it has been for billions of years.  It just happens to be at perigee in its orbit around the earth when its full.  The moon is on an elliptical orbit meaning in its travels there are times when it's closer than other times.  Perigee is when the moon is at its closest point in its orbit.  This is simple orbital mechanics.  It happens.  It's like predictable and you've probably seen it before and thought """"wow, the moon looks so obvious.""""  And, yo probably didn't use super in your description.<br /> <br /> Words making it sound like it's the regular moon except on steroids don't have to be used to adequately describe whats going on (no drugs were involved in the size of the moon unless you happen to use them yourself).  I believe words such as """"super"""" that emphasize the dramatic should be reserved for those times when it is special.  After all, what word do you use when there's truly something amazing going on, like a once in a lifetime event?  Do you use """"super awesome"""" as a way to taking it to """"11""""--if you've seen the movie, """"This is Spinal Tap,"""" you'll understand what taking it to """"11"""" means.<br /> <br /> I made my way to Monument Valley this past weekend to shoot the full moon.  It was a great night with clouds, color, and wonderful scenery.  Not everything came together just as I hoped.  The moon was too low in an obscuring haze when the last red light of the setting sun disappeared from the Mittens.  Still, it was a wonderful sight to behold.<br /> <br /> Cheers<br /> <br /> Tom"""

"""The river Arno and Ponte Vecchio bridge in Firenze (Florence), Italy.<br /> -----<br /> Captured with a Canon 5D Mk III camera and Canon EF 24-105/4L IS lens  <br /> -----<br /> Florence (Italian: Firenze) is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the province of Florence. The Ponte Vecchio (""""Old Bridge"""") is a Medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno River, in Florence, Italy, noted for still having shops built along it, as was once common. Butchers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewellers, art dealers and souvenir sellers. The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie. The bridge spans the Arno at its narrowest point where it is believed that a bridge was first built in Roman times, when the via Cassia crossed the river at this point. The Roman piers were of stone, the superstructure of wood. The bridge first appears in a document of 996. After being destroyed by a flood in 1117 it was reconstructed in stone but swept away again in 1333 save two of its central piers, as noted by Giovanni Villani in his Nuova Cronica. It was rebuilt in 1345, Giorgio Vasari recorded the tradition in his day, that attributed its design to Taddeo Gaddi, besides Giotto one of the few artistic names of the trecento still recalled two hundred years later. Modern historians present Neri di Fioravanti as a possible candidate. Sheltered in a little loggia at the central opening of the bridge is a weathered dedication stone, which once read Nel trentatrè dopo il mille-trecento, il ponte cadde, per diluvio dell' acque: poi dieci anni, come al Comun piacque, rifatto fu con questo adornamento. The Torre dei Mannelli was built at the southeast corner of the bridge to defend it.<br /> The bridge consists of three segmental arches: the main arch has a span of 30 meters (98 ft) the two side arches each span 27 meters (88 ft). The rise of the arches is between 3.5 and 4.4 meters (11"""

Although the insane color of the lake might make you think otherwise, the lake really is this blue - in fact in my search of pictures of Moraine Lake on the web, I have not been able to find an image that captures the scale, color, and beauty of this amazing place better than this image.<br /> <br /> I have this image available for purchase printed on a stunning 55x17"" fine art gallery wrapped canvas (other sizes available but due to the incredible resolution of 30 combined images, it is best viewed BIG!)

A 360&deg; night panorama, lit by moonlight, taken from the boardwalk out to Pryamid Island on Pyramid Lake in Jasper National Park. Contructed in the 1930s, the Boardwalk takes you to a popular picnic spot, Pyramid Island at the north end of Pyramid Lake. The view across the water to the surrounding mountains is wonderful by day and by night. By night, this is a fabulous place for stargazing in this Dark Sky Preserve. <br /> <br /> Here, south is at left, toward Mt. Edith Cavell. To the southwest, the waxing gibbous Moon is setting. At right of centre, the Boardwalk leads to Pyramid Island itself, with Pyramid Mountain behind it. Right of the island is the Big Dipper. To the right of the image, to the northeast, there&rsquo;s a weak aurora display. The Milky Way is faintly visible in the moonlit sky overhead. <br /> <br /> This an 8-segement panorama, taken with the 15mm full-frame fisheye lens and Canon 6D. Each segment was a 32-second exposure at f/2.8 and ISO 1250, stitched with PTGui.
