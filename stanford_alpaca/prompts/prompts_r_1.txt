A plate of food with some eggs, potatoes, bread, and some other items on it, set on a table with a pitcher of milk and a bowl of fruit in the background.
The strawberries was sitting beside the tall glass of milkshake, which was decorated with whipped cream and cherries on top. There were a few strawberries on the plate as well.
